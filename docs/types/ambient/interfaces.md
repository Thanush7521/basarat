### Interfaces
Interfaces have *zero* runtime JS impact. There is a lot of power in TypeScript interfaces to declare the structure of variables.

The following two are equivalent declarations, the first uses an *inline annotation*, the second uses an *interface*:

```ts
// Sample A
declare var myPoint: { x: number; y: number; };

// Sample B
interface Point {
    x: number; y: number;
}
declare var myPoint: Point;
```

However the beauty of *Sample B* is that if someone authors a library that builds on the `myPoint` library to add new members they can do that only if you used an interface:

```ts
// Lib a.d.ts
interface Point {
    x: number; y: number;
}
declare var myPoint: Point;

// Lib b.d.ts
interface Point {
    x: number; y: number; z: number;
}

// Your code
var myPoint.z; // Allowed!
```

This is because **interfaces in TypeScript are open ended**. This is a vital tenet of TypeScript that it allows you to mimic the extensibility of JavaScript using *interfaces*.
